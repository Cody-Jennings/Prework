    <h3>Hello, welcome to my webpage! I hope you enjoy reading a little about me. If you have any questions feel free to ask.</h3>

    <p id="codyindexintro">I am a Marine veteran with a skillset in physical security but looking to expand my horizon into the digital frontier. I love everything outdoors, riding my Harley, and driving my antique Chevrolet.
       I look forward to working with everybody viewing my webpage. I am a PADI certified Rescue diver. I have a 2017 Harley Davidson Street Glide Special, and a 1930 2 door/5 window Chevrolet Sedan. 
       I also still have the original wheels/tires for my antique car. My older brother was my role model growing up and he became a Marine when I was in elementary school. I followed suite as soon as I graduated highschool and became a Marine.
       I worked on MV-22B Osprey aircraft and became a Marine Security Guard for various embassies abroad.</p>

    <p>This is the Marine Corps emblem, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle,_Globe,_and_Anchor">EGA </a> or Eagle, Globe, and Anchor.</p>

    <p>Below are some items and tasks I find intriguing, for various reasons.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Though some tasks are daunting I enjoy fixing mechanical issues. That way I am familiar with the task in the future.</li>
        <li>I enjoy taking things apart and understanding the inner workings of a product. How does the product work?</li>
        <li>Trying new foods and getting immersed in different cultures.</li>
    </ul>
